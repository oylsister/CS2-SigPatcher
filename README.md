# CS2-SigPatcher

This plugin is basically compact version of CS2Fixes and used for my server. CS2Fixes has many detours that overlap with VirtualFunctions in CSSharp as the result could caused the server to crash. And I want just a few things from them and decided to copy pasta code from their repo.

Which mean all credits go to CS2Fixes authors. Thank you.

PS. You can't toggle or disable it when load into the server, I'm too lazy for that.

### Feature
- Trigger_push fix
- Movement Unlocker
- Water Jump fix
- Remove Subtick Movement.
